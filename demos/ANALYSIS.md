## Evidence provenance

### Generated source evidence

These 18 checks and metrics are synchronized from the selected generated
source artifact at `artifacts/demo_analysis/analysis_report.json`, produced by
the headless/demo portion of the real `python tools/run_production_gate.py
--include-gui` run. The gate run started at `2026-07-27T16:39:08Z` under HEAD
`77a4931fb6d16f749628141b5f25aa33017cde5f`.
The bounded source profiles are the checked-in `demos/dam_break/meta.json`
and `demos/crown_splash/meta.json`: 128,000 particles over 72 frames for
`dam_break`, and 259,112 particles over 48 frames for `crown_splash`.
This selected run reports dam-break column height `0.0798046589 m`, front-speed
ratio `1.0117893136`, crown height `0.3577636480 m`, and crown-radius
correlation `0.9715359144`; it passes all 18 bounded checks. Values are bounded
run evidence, not arbitrary-scale physical claims.

### Review evidence

Runtime review evidence is separate from the generated metric table:
`artifacts/gui_playback_probe.json` records live CUDA playback on `cuda:0`
through solver frame 5 with 128,000 particles, a changed viewport, and
`passed=true`; its validator reports `SAVED-DEMO-GUI-PLAYBACK-PASS`. The
interactive GUI lane also reports `GUI-ACCEPTANCE-PASS (35/35)`. Review
evidence validates execution and playback but does not replace the generated
source metrics.
