# Release 3.0 status

The task record for executing `docs/RELEASE_3_0_PLAN.md`. The orchestrator updates it at
each dispatch, merge and gate. Newest state wins; history lives in git.

## Bases and baselines

| Ref | Commit | Suite | Demo artifact sha256 |
|---|---|---|---|
| master | `cc36403` | 2079 passed, 3 skipped | `2cb4f781…3a73` (GUI gate reference) |
| release/3.0 base: master + merge of release/2.1.0 | `94c79eb` | 2104 passed, 3 skipped | pending headless bake |
| `archive/st-flip-final` tag (local) | `94c79eb` | | |

- Demo artifact = `artifacts/demo_analysis/analysis_report.json`, the file the production
  gate hashes. The orchestrator recomputes it headless after every merge that touches
  `sim/` or `properties.py`.
- Refactor merges must keep it identical.

## Deviations from the plan

1. **The branch base is not a shipped 2.1.1.**
   - The plan branches `release/3.0` off master once 2.1.1 ships.
   - Shipping is an external action, and the owner's 2.1.1 version bump is still
     uncommitted in the main checkout.
   - So `release/3.0` is master plus a merge of `release/2.1.0` at `cd39e78`, which
     carries the plan, the Demo Gallery and the kernel prewarm.
   - The 2.1.1 bump will merge in when it is committed.
2. **Lane worktrees are created by hand** from `release/3.0` under `C:\Users\Tyler\wt\`,
   not with the Agent tool's worktree isolation.
   - That isolation would base each lane on the main checkout's branch, `release/2.1.0`.
3. **Wave 0 runs in two steps.**
   - D (ST-FLIP removal) shares `properties.py`, `pending_settings.py`, `ui_scene.py`,
     `solver_settings.py` and `pressure.py` with A and C.
   - So D, B and E go first. A and C start once D is merged.
4. **Lane E's Linux offscreen check** goes into
   `tests/acceptance/blender_gui_acceptance.py` and a new helper module, not
   `tools/run_production_gate.py`.
   - That script is what the gate runs for the viewport check.
5. **Lane E takes REVIEW-024 and REVIEW-025.** The plan's lane table gives them to E;
   one bullet suggests doing them with the split instead. E lands before A starts, so
   the split rebases on top.

## Lanes

| Lane | Branch | Worktree | Head | Tests | Blocker | Next action |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| D st-flip-removal | `3.0/lane-d-stflip-removal` | `C:\Users\Tyler\wt\r30-d` | `94c79eb` | | | dispatched |
| B cache-v3 | `3.0/lane-b-cache-v3` | `C:\Users\Tyler\wt\r30-b` | `94c79eb` | | | dispatched |
| E hygiene | `3.0/lane-e-hygiene` | `C:\Users\Tyler\wt\r30-e` | `94c79eb` | | | dispatched |
| A split | | | | | waits for D | dispatch after D merges |
| C multigrid | | | | | waits for D | dispatch after D merges |

Lane briefs are under `C:\Users\Tyler\wt\r30_briefs\`, outside the repository. Each is
`docs/specs/3.0/WORKER_BRIEF_TEMPLATE.md` filled in, with a shared environment section.
